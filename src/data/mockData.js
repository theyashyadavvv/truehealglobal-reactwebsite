        category: "Hydrogen Water",
        question: "What is hydrogen water and how is it different from regular water?",
        answer: "Hydrogen water is regular purified water (H₂O) infused with extra molecular hydrogen (H₂) gas. While chemically it contains the same H₂O molecules, the dissolved hydrogen acts as a powerful antioxidant that can penetrate cells and mitochondria — something regular water cannot do. Over 1,000 scientific studies support the health benefits of molecular hydrogen."
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        category: "Hydrogen Water",
        question: "How does a hydrogen water machine work?",
        answer: "Our hydrogen water machines use PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) and SPE (Solid Polymer Electrolyte) technology to split water molecules through electrolysis. This process generates pure molecular hydrogen that dissolves into the water while separating and venting any byproduct gases like ozone and chlorine, ensuring you get only clean, hydrogen-rich water."
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        category: "Hydrogen Water",
        question: "What is the ideal hydrogen concentration (ppb) for health benefits?",
        answer: "Research suggests a minimum of 0.5 mg/L (500 ppb) of dissolved hydrogen for therapeutic benefits. Our machines produce between 800-1600 ppb depending on the model, well above the therapeutic threshold. Higher concentrations generally provide greater antioxidant activity."
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        category: "Alkaline Water",
        question: "What is alkaline water and what are the benefits?",
        answer: "Alkaline water has a pH higher than 7 (typically between 8-10). Our ionizers use titanium platinum plates to restructure water, creating micro-clustered alkaline water that is more easily absorbed by cells. Benefits include better hydration, acid reflux relief, improved bone health, and enhanced mineral absorption."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        category: "Alkaline Water",
        question: "What pH level should I be drinking?",
        answer: "For daily drinking, a pH of 8.5-9.5 is generally recommended. Start with a lower pH (8.0-8.5) and gradually increase as your body adjusts. Our machines allow you to select and customize the pH level. pH above 10 is best used for cooking, while pH below 4 is useful for cleaning and sanitizing."
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        category: "Alkaline Water",
        question: "How is alkaline water different from hydrogen water?",
        answer: "While both offer health benefits, they work differently. Alkaline water has a higher pH which helps neutralize acid in the body. Hydrogen water contains dissolved molecular hydrogen which acts as a selective antioxidant. Some of our premium systems produce water that is both alkaline AND hydrogen-rich for maximum benefits."
    },
    {
        id: 7,
        category: "Science",
        question: "What is ORP and why does it matter?",
        answer: "ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential) measures water's ability to act as an antioxidant. Regular tap water has a positive ORP (+200 to +400 mV), meaning it oxidizes. Our machines produce water with strongly negative ORP (-300 to -800 mV), meaning it donates electrons to neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative damage in your body."
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        category: "Science",
        question: "Are the health claims backed by research?",
        answer: "Yes. Over 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies published in journals like Nature Medicine, the Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition, and Medical Gas Research have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of molecular hydrogen in over 170 disease models across every organ of the human body."
    },
    {
        id: 9,
        category: "Products",
        question: "How long do the machines last?",
        answer: "Our hydrogen water bottles last 3-5 years with proper care. The PEM membrane typically retains 90%+ efficiency for over 5,000 cycles. Countertop alkaline ionizers last 15-20 years, with plate lifespans of 10,000+ hours. We offer comprehensive warranties ranging from 1 to 8 years depending on the product."
    },
    {
        id: 10,
        category: "Products",
        question: "Do I need to replace any parts or filters?",
        answer: "Hydrogen water bottles typically do not require filter replacements — just regular cleaning. Alkaline water ionizers require filter changes every 6-12 months depending on usage and water quality. Replacement filters are available through our store. The titanium plates themselves do not need replacement."
    },
    {
        id: 11,

If you want a permanent home solution with multiple water types, our countertop or under-sink alkaline ionizers are ideal. Contact our team for a personalized recommendation."
